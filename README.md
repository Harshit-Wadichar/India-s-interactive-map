ðŸš€ Introducing My Latest Creation: The Interactive Map of India
I've developed an interactive map of India using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With this tool, you can click on each state to learn more about it, including state number, name, capital, area, population, and the current temperature of the capital city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
The SVG map and images utilized in this website was sourced online. Full credit and acknowledgment of SVG map and images go to the original creator.
